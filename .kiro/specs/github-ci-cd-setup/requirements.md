# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a comprehensive GitHub CI/CD pipeline for the decomment CLI tool project. The system will automate testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes while ensuring proper branch protection and status checks are in place to maintain code quality and security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated testing on every pull request, so that I can ensure code changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL automatically run the Jest test suite
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent the pull request from being merged
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL display a green status check
4. IF the test suite takes longer than 10 minutes THEN the system SHALL timeout and report failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want code quality checks on every pull request, so that I can maintain consistent code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run linting checks
2. WHEN code coverage is below 80% THEN the system SHALL report a warning status
3. WHEN linting errors are found THEN the system SHALL prevent merging until fixed
4. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL block the pull request

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want branch protection rules enforced, so that the main branch remains stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone attempts to push directly to main THEN the system SHALL reject the push
2. WHEN a pull request targets main THEN the system SHALL require at least one approval
3. WHEN status checks are failing THEN the system SHALL prevent merging
4. WHEN a pull request is not up to date with main THEN the system SHALL require updates before merging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated dependency updates to be properly tested, so that security updates don't break the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependabot creates a pull request THEN the system SHALL run all status checks
2. WHEN dependency updates pass all tests THEN the system SHALL allow auto-merge for patch updates
3. WHEN major version updates are proposed THEN the system SHALL require manual review
4. IF dependency updates introduce security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL block the update

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated package publishing, so that new versions are released consistently when ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new tag is pushed THEN the system SHALL automatically publish to npm
2. WHEN publishing fails THEN the system SHALL notify maintainers via GitHub issues
3. WHEN a release is created THEN the system SHALL generate release notes automatically
4. IF the package version already exists THEN the system SHALL skip publishing without error
